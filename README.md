## Challenge 2

### A confession

I wasn't use `Hapi.js` much recently. And I've never been setup `React` with Hapi.js before. I normally use Hapi as a REST API for a quick and small projects. I'm still not figuring out why it's not working with `hapi-react-views`. Even I clone the example from [Official Repo](https://github.com/hapijs/vision/tree/master/examples/jsx) and just run it also not working.

For React. My go to framework is `Next.js`. I'm confidence working on any existing projects. But setting up Hapi with React I need to do more research.

So for challenge part 2. I didn't finish it.
